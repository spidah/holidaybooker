== Cookies ==

Your application can store small amounts of data on the client - called cookies - that will be persisted across requests and even sessions. Rails provides easy access to cookies via the `cookies` method, which - much like the `session` - works like a hash:

TODO: Find a real-world example where cookies are used

[source, ruby]
-----------------------------------------
class FooController < ApplicationController

  def foo
    cookies[:foo] = "bar"
  end

  def display_foo
    @foo = cookies[:foo]
  end

  def remove_foo
    cookies.delete(:foo)
  end

end
-----------------------------------------

Note that while for session values, you set the key to `nil`, to delete a cookie value, you use `cookies.delete(:key)`.
